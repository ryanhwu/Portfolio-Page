    <p>Hello! I'm Ryan, a recent graduate in User Experience Design. I am a passionate advocate of User-Centered Design and Design Thinking and I believe this mindset can be applied to any discipline to create pleasant human experiences.</p>
    <p>As a UX Designer with a diverse background in Music, Education, and E-Commerce, I am constantly intrigued by the many creative ways to solve problems in order to improve processes and to empower users - whether if they are students, consumers, or even concert audience. Having studied and lived in 6 countries across the globe, I possess outstanding foreign language skills and intercultural sensibility, which are vital skills in understanding very different groups of users around the world and communicating with international clients as well as colleagues. With 3 years of experience at Booking.com, I was able to grow and gain tremendous expertise in the fields of User Experience and E-commerce. I've adopted user-centered mindset by providing inspiring content to drive conversion and maintaining content accuracy to minimize user frictions.</p>
    <p>My goal is to utilize my international experiences in combination with my UX Design skills to not only create intuitive user experiences, but also deliver seamless and memorable designs at a company where I also have the chance to grow and learn from fellow colleagues.</p>
    <p>Aside from the world of UX, I am an active globetrotter - I love learning new languages and exploring different corners of the earth. I also enjoy cooking and keeping a healthy life style. I am based in Berlin, Germany but originally from Temple City, California.</p>
